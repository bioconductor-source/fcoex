Description: The fcoex package implements an easy-to use interface to co-expression analysis based on the FCBF (Fast Correlation-Based Filter) algorithm. it was implemented especifically to deal with single-cell data. The modules found can be used to redefine cell populations, unrevel novel gene associations and predict gene function by guilt-by-association. The package structure is adapted from the CEMiTool package, relying on visualizations and code designed and written by CEMiTool's authors.
